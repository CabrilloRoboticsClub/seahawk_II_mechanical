# CAD
All CAD for Seahawk II was done in Solidworks 2023 using student licenses. Our mechincal desingn was done using Onedrive and a custome vertion control system and are now open sourced on GrabCAD as Git/ GitHub does not handle large binary files well

After downlading from GrabCAD Navage to the Top levels listed bellow. I would suggesting being in light weight mode while working with the top level CAD of the ROV

| Item | Top Level Assy Name |
|----------|----------|
| ROV Top Level | `Garties_ROVAssm.SLDASM` |
| ROV Top Level | `Garties_ROVAssm_MarketingDisplay.SLDDRW` |
| VPF Top Level | `VerticalProfilingFloat.SLDASM` |
| Tooling| N/A |

All tooling is sorted into indvigal folders even if integrated into ROV top level
